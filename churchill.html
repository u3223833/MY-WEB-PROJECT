        Churchill House, at 216 Northbourne Avenue in Braddon, was designed by Robin Boyd for the 
        Winston Churchill Memorial Trust of Australia in 1969-70, and construction was completed in 1971. 
        It was Boyd’s last major commission, and he died prior to its completion. 
        It is one of a small number of larger designs produced by Boyd and was Canberra’s first brutalist 
        building.
<br>
Several components make up the complex. 
The main building, with east and south wings; the separate north wing or pavilion; 
the central pool and a rear carpark. The main building forms an L shape and with the north wing 
it encloses a courtyard with a large ornamental pool. The main building is three storeys high 
with a four storey lift tower at the southeast corner. The north wing and the carpark are two storeyed.
<br>
Although it has undergone some alterations over the years, the building still displays key features 
of the brutalist style with its large areas of blank wall and use off-form concrete, sloping structural 
fins and precast concrete non-loadbearing wall panels, precast fins for sun protection, and vertical 
slit windows. Churchill House displays a fairly restrained form in comparison with the major Canberra 
buildings that followed in this style: Cameron Offices, National Gallery of Australia and High Court of 
Australia. </p>

<h2> DESCRIPTION</h2>
<p>Churchill House was designed by Robin Boyd for the Winston Churchill Memorial Trust of Australia 
  in 1969-70 and construction was completed in 1971. 
  The building is an example of the Late Twentieth-Century Brutalist Style (1960-) with its large 
  areas of blank wall and off-form concrete.

  The complex comprises a number of components: 
  the main building with its east and south wings, the separate north wing or pavilion, 
  the pool and the rear carpark. The main building forms an L shape in plan, and with the north wing 
  it encloses on three sides a courtyard in which the pool is located. 
  The main building is of three storeys with a four storey lift tower at the southeast corner, 
  the north wing is of two storeys, and the carpark is two storeyed.</p>

  <h3>MAIN BUILDING</h3>
  <p> The main building displays several different elevational treatments. 
    The elevations facing onto the pool area feature floor to ceiling glass with minimal black 
    metal frames to the lowest level, and precast vertical panels on the upper two storeys. 
    Each panel has a projecting fin and are relatively narrow, with the overall affect being of 
    closely spaced vertical fins. Beside the fins are narrow, slot windows providing minimal 
    outlook onto the pool area.
<br>
    The south and east elevations are quite different in character having long horizontal sections 
    of flush-mounted glazing set in minimal black metal frames, with timber-textured off-form concrete 
    spandrels between storeys. The base course of the elevation is a large section black-coated steel 
    beam. Several window-mounted airconditioners are located on the south elevation. 
    The blank end walls of the wings and the lift tower are off-form, timber-textured concrete 
    with incised storey lines.
    <br>
    At the junction of the two wings are the foyers for each floor as well as the service core including
    the lift. Apart from the off-form concrete walls of the service elements, the foyers 
    feature glazing set in black metal frames which extends the full height of the building. 
    At the ground floor level the glazing is vertical but above that for the remaining two storeys 
    it is sloping.
    <br>
    The building has concrete slab floors which are either carpeted or finished in slate. 
    Some interior walls are textured, off-form concrete similar to the exterior. 
    Other walls are lightweight partitions. There is a mixture of ceiling treatments: 
    off-form concrete, suspended ceilings and set plasterboard. Many of the interior fitouts 
    appear relatively modern and are not original.
    <br>
    The roof of the main building is set behind a parapet and appears to be graded concrete with a 
    membrane coating.</p>

    <h3>north wing</h3>
    <p> The north wing replaces an earlier pavilion on the same location. 
      The current wing is a two storey structure with a flat metal deck roof set behind a parapet. 
      The wing has an encircling steel colonnade which supports the roof and parapet. 
      The walls are set back from the colonnade and feature flush-mounted glazing set in thin 
      black metal frames, with textured off-form concrete spandrels, similar to the south wall 
      of the south wing. There is an enclosed link between the north and east wings at the ground 
      floor level.</p>

      <h3>pool area, carpark, and landscaping</h3>
      <p>The pool area is lower than the surrounding site, and being mostly enclosed by the wings, 
        has the quality of a sunken courtyard. The pool area is reached by a large flight of concrete 
        steps from the west, and features a pond which borders a large, raised central island which 
        is reached from one side by a set of bridging steps. The island has concrete paving, garden 
        beds and silver birch trees, and is the location for a large fibreglass statue of Sir Winston 
        Churchill.
        <br>
  The carpark is constructed in off-form concrete, with walls displaying the texture of the timber 
  formwork. Churchill House has a number of landscape/garden areas. 
  At the front (west) of the building is an open lawn area and either side 
  are mixed native/exotic plantings. The pool area contains numerous trees and shrubs, 
  again of mixed native/exotic species. 
  A small courtyard to the southeast of the main building features bamboo.</p>

  <h3>Stylistic Analysis</h3>
  <p>Churchill House displays several key features of the Late Twentieth Century Brutalist style as 
    follows.
    <li> Large areas of blank wall, especially the west wall of the south wing.</li>
    <li>Off-form concrete, such as the west wall of the south wing and the spandrels to the south and east wings.</li>
    In addition, it displays a number of the other features of this style.
    <li>Sloping structural fins, being the structural steel members supporting the glazing at the corner between the east and south wings.</li>
    <li>Precast concrete non-loadbearing wall panels, being the cladding to the wings facing the pool area.</li>
    <li>Precast fins for sun protection, as above.</li>
    <li>Vertical slit windows, also being a part of the cladding to the wings facing the pool area.</li>
    
    The building generally appears to be in fair to good condition. 
    A number of changes have been made which diminish its integrity including:
    <li>the replacement of the original glass pavilion with the current north wing, 
      albeit with a sympathetic design.</li>
    </p>

    <h3>history</h3>
    <p>Churchill House was built by the Winston Churchill Memorial Trust of Australia. 
      The Trust began consideration of erecting a building of its own in 1967 and formed a 
      building committee in 1968. In 1969 it acquired a lease for land on Northbourne Avenue, 
      the current site, and engaged the architect Robin Boyd to design the building.
<br>
      The building was to provide offices for the Trust and in addition was to provide rental office 
      accommodation for commercial tenants as a means of generating income for the Trust. 
      Features of the original design included:
      
      <li>a glass exhibition pavilion, on the site of the current north wing, which housed a display on the work of the Trust;</li>
      <li>the flat roof area of the east and south wings which was intended to be a roof terrace; and</li>
      <li>accommodation in the building included a board room, dining room, reception area, bar and kitchen.</li>
      
     <p>The cost of the works was about $1 million. 
      The building was officially opened on 14 April 1972.
      Boyd died in 1971 before completion, and W K Williams was engaged by the Trust as its site 
      representative to replace Boyd. Robin Boyd CBE HFRAIA (1919-1971) is a noted Australian architect.
      Boyd was a member of a prominent artistic family, and combined a career as an architect, 
      author and critic (Clerehan 1993). He was strongly influenced by the Modern Movement, 
      and deeply interested in the development of Australian architecture. 
      Boyd is often remembered best for his domestic architecture, as well as his books, 
      but he also produced designs for larger scale works, such as in the case of Churchill House. 
      Boyd was awarded the Gold Medal by the RAIA in 1969, and made an honorary fellow in 1970.
      <br>
      Boyd was strongly influenced later in his career by the post-war concrete architecture produced in Japan (Taylor 1990:80). 
      This Brutalist style is evident in the design for Menzies College Student Housing (1968) and in 
      the design for Churchill House. In this latter phase, Boyd was seeking larger scale projects, 
      although with only limited success. During the 1990s(?) the glass pavilion was replaced by the current north wing.</p>
      
     <p>Churchill House is one of a number of Canberra buildings designed in the Late Twentieth Century Brutalist style. These include:
      
      - National Gallery of Australia, 1971;
      - Cameron Offices, 1976;
      - Canberra School of Music, 1976; and
      - High Court of Australia, 1980.
      
      Churchill House is an early example in this context, and one of only two examples of an office building. While Brutalism has been described as an ethic rather than an aesthetic (Banham 1966:10), both office buildings display a more restrained form compared to the other buildings, several of which were intended to portray a distinctive image in the national capital.
