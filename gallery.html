                OBJECT NO. 2001/112/1
                <br />
                <br />This chair represents the international success enjoyed by
                Australian designer Marc Newson. The Powerhouse Museum has
                supported Newson since early in his career, acquiring one of his
                first chairs, the 'Marc 1', in 1985 and commissioning the
                'Embryo' chair in 1988 for the exhibition 'Take a seat'. Like
                the 'Lockheed Lounge', it has since become one of Newson's
                signature pieces and a twentieth century design icon.

                <br />
                <br />The 'Ray Chair' is an excellent example of contemporary
                international furniture design that follows the growing trend
                that looks towards the natural world for inspiration. In the
                case of the 'Ray Chair' it is the growth of crystals in which he
                finds his inspiration. The inspiration for his other chairs
                including the 'Clover' and 'Blossom' is self-explanatory but
                antlers, bones, and microscopic cellular arrangement have been
                nominated by him as his muse for others designs.

                <br />Gordon Andrews (1914-2001) was a multi-disciplinary
                Australian designer of both local and international
                significance. The Gazelle chair represents an important aspect
                of his work - furniture design. This graceful three legged
                'Gazelle' chair, made of plywood, cast aluminium, steel and
                wool, is a slightly modified version of a chair Andrews designed
                during his time as design consultant to the Italian firm
                Olivetti.

                The 'Coconut' chair, made of enamelled sheet steel, steel rod,
                polyurethane foam and wool fabric, was designed in the USA by
                George Nelson in 1955 and made in America by Herman Miller Inc
                between 1955 and 1964. The use of mouldable materials in the
                1950s made possible an unlimited range of shapes and styles -
                many of them with a humorous twist like this one.

                <br />The 'DAF' chair, made of fibreglass reinforced polyester
                and chromium plated steel with rubber shock mounts, was designed
                in the USA by George Nelson and made in 1958 by Herman Miller
                Inc of Zeeland, Michigan. The DAF was a development of the Eames
                plastic chair. It was designed to be mass produced in pieces for
                easy shipping and assembly. George Nelson was an influential
                designer best known for his work as design director for the
                furniture company Herman Miller.

                <br />This chair is perhaps the only surviving example of a
                pre-production (prototype) version of the immensely successful
                'Integra' chair that was to become the first one-piece stackable
                moulded polypropylene chair in the world (Watson 2002: 59). It
                is a valuable record of the process and experimentation that is
                part of developing a highly successful product, and is an
                exemplar of the dogged determination a designer needs to
                exercise in order to fulfil their brief.

                edition since the late 1980s, it is now an international design

                <br />The 'Ciprea' armchair, made of injection moulded
                polyurethane foam with a plywood base and synthetic fabric
                cover, was designed in Italy by Tobia and Afra Scarpa in 1968.
                It has been manufactured by Cassina in Italy since 1968 and this
                one dates from 1985. During the 1960s and 1970s many chair
                designers experimented with the sculptural possibilities of
                synthetic foam. The Ciprea was one of the first armchairs to be
                made of solid moulded foam without any internal frame.
