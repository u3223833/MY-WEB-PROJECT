# Rationale for Responsive Website

## Reflection

This project allowed me to explore both the design and technical sides of building a multi-page website. One of the main things I think I did well was the overall layout and visual consistency of the site. I used a clear colour scheme, appropriate fonts, and consistent spacing to create a visually appealing experience. I also managed to incorporate interactive elements like a timeline and animated image fades, which made the website feel more engaging and modern.

A part I could have improved was the responsiveness of some sections. While the homepage adjusts well on smaller screens, a few of the project cards and full-width images do not scale as effectively as they could. If I had more time, I would have spent longer refining the mobile experience and testing it across multiple devices.

Another area for improvement is optimising the CSS. I cleaned it up towards the end, but earlier versions were cluttered with repeated code and commented-out sections. Moving forward, I will work on keeping my codebase cleaner from the beginning.

## Prototypes and Implementation

I designed my initial prototype in Figma and created a screen recording to test how the layout would feel on a desktop. My main goals were to keep the structure clean, easy to navigate, and aligned with the visual identity of Robin Boyd’s architectural style—minimal, balanced, and functional.

In the prototype, I focused on clear navigation, with a fixed top bar and large headings to introduce each section. I used generous padding, structured grids for the project thumbnails, and hover effects to guide interaction. The hero section in particular had a layered text-image arrangement, which I kept almost exactly the same in the final build because it visually captured the mood I was aiming for.

A few features were added or slightly changed as I developed the website. 
For instance:
- I refined the transitions so that text and images fade in as users scroll, which was not shown in the prototype but added a smooth interactive touch to the final version.
- I originally intended the project pages to open as modal pop-ups, but I changed them to full detail pages instead. This allowed more room to explore each house with more content and imagery.
- Typography and spacing were slightly adjusted during coding to work better with real content, and I introduced soft animations on hover to make the interface more engaging.

Overall, the prototype gave me a solid base to work from, and most of its design decisions were successfully implemented in the final build, with a few thoughtful changes made to improve usability and responsiveness.

## Design Theories and Concepts

While designing the website, I applied several visual communication principles explored in class. I used a **grid-based layout**, influenced by Swiss Style (also known as the International Typographic Style), which values clarity, balance, and function. This helped ensure my content was well-aligned and easy to read.

I also considered **User-Centred Design (UCD)** when thinking about accessibility, especially for older audiences who may be more interested in Robin Boyd’s work. I kept font sizes readable, avoided overwhelming colours, and ensured the navigation was intuitive. These choices were guided by what we learnt from *Don Norman’s* ideas on usability and affordances in design (*The Design of Everyday Things*).

Finally, my decision to use a **minimalist aesthetic** was informed by Robin Boyd’s own design philosophy and his criticism of visual pollution, especially in his book *The Australian Ugliness* (1960). This guided me to keep the interface clean, with simple colour choices, negative space, and focus on structure over decoration.

- **CSS Tricks (https://css-tricks.com/):** Helped me understand responsive layout strategies and animation techniques like transitions and `@keyframes`.
- **FontAwesome (https://fontawesome.com/):** I considered using icon fonts for the navigation but decided to stick to text for simplicity.

- **Figma (https://www.figma.com/):** Used for my initial wireframes and design planning.

## Use of GenAI

I used ChatGPT to help review and clean up my CSS code. It pointed out repeated sections and suggested how to consolidate rules and fix small typos. I also asked for guidance on animation timing and media query structure, which helped me make the site more polished.
