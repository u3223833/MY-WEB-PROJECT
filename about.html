      <h2>Modern Australian Architecture</h2>
      
      <p>
        Robin Gerard Penleigh Boyd (1919–1971) was an Australian architect, 
        writer, and critic. He is best known for his dedication to functional 
        modern design and his critiques of Australian architectural identity.
      
        Boyd’s book <em>The Australian Ugliness</em> (1960) challenged 
        conventional aesthetics, sparking debates about the nation’s suburban 
        landscape. His forward-thinking approach continues to influence architects 
        today.

        This website explores his life, architectural philosophies, and notable 
        projects that remain a testament to his innovative vision.

      <h2>the man in question.</h2>
      <p>
          Robin Gerard Penleigh Boyd (1919-1971) was a nationally and internationally renowned architect. 
          He was also widely published and appreciated as an architectural critic. 
          In 1953 Robin Boyd, Roy Grounds and Frederick Romberg formed the practice of Grounds, 
          Romberg and Boyd which became a leading architectural firm in Melbourne. 
          The firm also practiced extensively in Canberra.
      </p>
  
      <p>
        Boyd authored several books, including the groundbreaking
        <em>The Australian Ugliness</em>, where he critiqued the aesthetic of Australian suburbs
        and sparked a nationwide conversation about design.
      </p>
      <p>
        Throughout his career, Boyd championed principles of simplicity, efficiency, and harmony
        with the environment—ideals that continue to inspire architects today.
