      <h2>The Man Behind Modern Australian Architecture</h2>
      <p>
        Robin Gerard Penleigh Boyd (1919–1971) was an Australian architect, 
        writer, and critic. He is best known for his dedication to functional 
        modern design and his critiques of Australian architectural identity.
      </p>
      <p>
        Boyd’s book <em>The Australian Ugliness</em> (1960) challenged 
        conventional aesthetics, sparking debates about the nation’s suburban 
        landscape. His forward-thinking approach continues to influence architects 
        today.
      </p>
      <p>
        This website explores his life, architectural philosophies, and notable 
        projects that remain a testament to his innovative vision.
