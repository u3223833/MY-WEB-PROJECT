        His architectural work is mostly known through his residential designs. 
            He was known for his ability to design houses that would meet client needs, 
            solve site problems and still retain architectural integrity. 
            The designs were heavily influenced by the functional and international 
            styles of architecture and became known as the Melbourne Regional style. 
            It was light, simple and elegant and unmistakably modern. 
            (Architecture Today 1972; Saunders 1972; and Serle 1995)</p>
