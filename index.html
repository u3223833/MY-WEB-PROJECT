      <h2>Who is Robin Boyd?</h2>
      <p>The man. The question.
        Robin Boyd (1919–1971) was more than an architect — 
        he was a fierce advocate for thoughtful, functional, 
        and beautiful Australian design. His legacy continues 
        to inspire generations.

      <h2>Shaping the Australian Landscape</h2>
      <p>
        Boyd believed architecture should respond to 
        its surroundings — not dominate them. 
        His work reflected a deep understanding of Australia's 
        climate, landscape, and lifestyle. By integrating indoor 
        and outdoor spaces, he pioneered designs that felt 
        uniquely at home in Australia.
  
        <br><br>
  
        His vision helped to carve a new path in architectural 
        thinking that still influences designers today.
