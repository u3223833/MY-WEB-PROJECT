      <h1>Who is Robin Boyd?</h1>
      <p1>The man. The question.<br>
        Robin Boyd (1919–1971) was more than an architect — 
        he was a fierce advocate for thoughtful, functional, 
        and beautiful Australian design. His legacy continues 
        to inspire generations</p1>

          <h2>Modern Australian Architecture, Redefining the Australian Home.</h2>
      <p>
        Robin Boyd was one of Australia’s most influential architects, writers,
        and critics. He championed a functional, minimalist approach that 
        influenced the direction of modern architecture in Australia.

        and the works that shaped Australia’s architectural landscape.

      <h1>Shaping the Australian Landscape</h1>
<div class="textbox1"

        <p>Boyd believed architecture should respond to 
          its surroundings — not dominate them. 
          His work reflected a deep understanding of Australia's 
          climate, landscape, and lifestyle. By integrating indoor 
          and outdoor spaces, he pioneered designs that felt 
          uniquely at home in Australia. 
          <br>
          <br>His vision helped to carve a new path in architectural 
          thinking that still influences designers today.
