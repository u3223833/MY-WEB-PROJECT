    <h2>Who is Robin Boyd?</h2>
    <p>
      Robin Gerard Penleigh Boyd (1919–1971) was one of Australia's most influential architects,
      writers, and critics. He is best known for his advocacy of functional, modern design and
      his writings on the Australian identity in architecture.
    </p>
    <p>
      Boyd authored several books, including the groundbreaking
      <em>The Australian Ugliness</em>, where he critiqued the aesthetic of Australian suburbs
      and sparked a nationwide conversation about design.
    </p>
    <p>
      Throughout his career, Boyd championed principles of simplicity, efficiency, and harmony
      with the environment—ideals that continue to inspire architects today.
