      <h2> BOYDS WORK.</h2>
<p> His architectural work is mostly known through his residential designs. 
    He was known for his ability to design houses that would meet client needs, 
    solve site problems and still retain architectural integrity. The designs were 
    heavily influenced by the functional and international styles of architecture and 
    became known as the Melbourne Regional style. It was light, simple and elegant and 
    unmistakably modern. <em></em></e>(Architecture Today 1972; Saunders 1972; and Serle 1995) </p>

    <p> In the 1960s he started to move away from the glass box functionalism of the
        International and Melbourne Regional styles arguing that it had a limited range 
        of expression and instead tried, somewhat unsuccessfully, to land large prestigious 
        commissions for advanced high-rise buildings. He submitted many designs, 
        but few were successful. Those that he did win tended to be of a more moderate size, 
        such as the Menzies College at La Trobe University or Churchill House. Taylor (1990:80) 
        notes that Boyd’s interest in Brutalism was heavily influenced by his travels in Japan and 
        he became known as the chief advocate in Australia for the “vigorous, concrete buildings 
        of post-war Japan”, but goes on to note that his own attempts at major Brutalist 
        designs show “...a somewhat crude, unexpressive, Brutalist aesthetic. </p></p>
