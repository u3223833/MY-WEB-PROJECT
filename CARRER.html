    <p>Although the three partners were prominent as individuals, 
        the firm maintained a strong design unity. Some buildings revealed the hand 
        of one or other of the architects, but in general the firm developed a 
        corporate style, combining the philosophies of the trio and representing 
        the advanced thinking of that era. They often worked or supervised on each 
        other’s projects. Their work was a distinctive Australian form of the 
        International Style, then called Contemporary. (Clerehan, 1993)

    Boyd joined the National Capital Planning Committee (NCPC) in January 1968 as 
        one of two architectural experts, the other being Professor Gordon Stephenson 
        from Western Australia. Boyd and Stephenson were charged with creating a 
        statement of civic design philosophy that would form the basis of the NCDC 
        policies relating to the Buildings (Design and Siting) Ordinance 1964. 
        These policies would guide the aesthetic, development principles and layout 
        of buildings in the National Capital areas of Canberra.

    Boyd’s residential designs that are registered on the ACT Heritage Register 
        include:

<li>Manning Clark’s House, 11 Tasmania Circle, Forrest (1952); </li>
<li>Fenner House, 8 Monaro Crescent, Red Hill (1953); </li> 
<li>Eltringham House, 12 Marawa Place, Aranda (1968-69). </li>
<br>

He is also credited with the following designs in the ACT:
<li>Dr Hilary Roche House, Bedford Street, Deakin (1954)</li>
<li>Zoology building ANU (1961)</li>
<li>Three houses in Vasey Crescent, Campbell (1961) (Grounds & Boyd)</li>
<li>W G Verge House, 204 Monaro Crescent, Red Hill (1963)</li>
<li>204 Monaro Crescent, Red Hill (1964)</li>
<li>Zoology Building ANU (1963-8).</li>

<p>Boyd’s later buildings are disappointing...”. 
Commentary in architectural journals and works on Boyd focus on his residential designs and larger 
Melbourne-based buildings. References to Churchill House mention that he was working on it at the 
time of his death, and the most favourable account comes from Serle’s 1995 biography that noted 
that it was the “only new work of any consequence” (p.308) and that tenders for “Boyd’s innovative 
design for Churchill House were surprisingly low” (p.309). Raisebeck (2017) noted that, 
“...Boyd’s works and writings from 1960- 1967 depict a relatively consistent commitment to a 
universal modernism tempered through a regional lense...exemplified in the earlier Zoology building”, 
while his later work demonstrates a stark change of focus and a less coherent whole with the different 
façades of Churchill House showing a different compositional treatment as a result of 
“...Boyd’s experimental bent and abandonment of an integrated and universal modernism.”

        Boyd received the Royal Australian Institute of Architects Gold Medal in 1969 
        and was awarded a Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire 
        (CBE) in 1971 for his services to architecture and government. 
        In the same year he died suddenly from a stroke while recovering
        from an anaesthetic as part of treatment for an infection. 
        As a result, his work on the Former Churchill House had to be completed by 
        another architect, Bill Williams, who had been employed by Boyd to work on 
        the project under the supervision of a more experienced architect, 
        Neil Clerehan (who later designed the second storey of the north wing to 
        replace the glass display pavilion). (Serle 1995)</p>
